Introduction
============

Building the project requires

- Android SDK API 18
- Android SDK Build-tools 18.1
- You might need to update Android SDK Tools to latest one too (>= 22.2.1)

This is due to android.support.v8 support library enabling RenderScript usage all
the way back to API 8. Now it remains to be seen does it really work on those devices.

Pretty much all the code is licenced under Apache 2.0 license.
